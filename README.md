# Campus-Helpdesk-and-Service-Portal
Campus Helpdesk and Service Portal is a web-based university support system that centralizes academic, technical, and administrative services into one platform. It integrates an AI chatbot, a categorized FAQ system, and a ticket management system to provide fast support, transparent tracking, and improved user experience for students and staff.

## Project Overview

In modern university environments, students and staff often struggle with fragmented support channels such as emails, phone calls, and in-person visits. These methods lead to delayed responses, repeated inquiries, and inefficient service handling.

The **Campus Helpdesk and Service Portal** addresses this problem by providing a centralized digital platform that combines:
- A categorized FAQ system
- An AI-powered chatbot
- A ticket submission and tracking system

This approach ensures faster responses, better transparency, and improved communication between users and support teams.
